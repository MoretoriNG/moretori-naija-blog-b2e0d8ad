    excerpt: 'Historic climate deal marks turning point as 190 nations commit to accelerated carbon reduction goals.',
    content: `<p>In a landmark development for global climate action, 190 nations have formally committed to an accelerated timeline for carbon neutrality, moving the collective target from 2050 to 2040.</p>
    <p>"This represents the most significant leap forward in international climate cooperation since the Paris Agreement," said UN Secretary-General António Guterres. "The science is clear that we must act more boldly and swiftly than previously thought."</p>
    <p>The new agreement includes substantially increased funding for climate adaptation in developing nations, with a particular focus on small island states and drought-prone regions in Africa and the Middle East.</p>
    <p>Financial commitments have reached $500 billion annually, more than double the previous target, with strict accountability mechanisms to ensure funds reach their intended recipients and achieve measurable outcomes.</p>`,

    title: 'Quantum Computing Breakthrough Promises New Era in Medicine',
    slug: 'quantum-computing-medicine-breakthrough',
    excerpt: 'Researchers achieve stable quantum processing at scale, enabling complex protein modeling for drug discovery.',
    content: `<p>A collaboration between IBM, Oxford University, and the Beijing Institute of Quantum Information Sciences has achieved what many experts are calling the "holy grail" of quantum computing: stable quantum processing at scale with minimal error correction overhead.</p>
    <p>The breakthrough, published simultaneously in Nature and Science, demonstrates the first practical application of quantum advantage in the modeling of complex protein folding—a critical process in drug discovery and disease research.</p>
    <p>"We can now simulate molecular interactions that would have taken traditional supercomputers centuries to calculate," said Dr. Michio Chang, lead researcher on the project. "This opens up entirely new frontiers in personalized medicine and disease treatment."</p>
    <p>Initial applications have focused on neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's and Parkinson's, with several promising drug candidates already identified for further testing.</p>`,

    excerpt: 'After 30 years of hostilities, rival factions sign comprehensive peace deal to rebuild war-torn region.',
    content: `<p>Representatives from opposing factions in the long-running Eastern Mediterranean conflict have signed a comprehensive peace agreement, ending three decades of hostilities that claimed more than 120,000 lives.</p>
    <p>The deal, brokered through two years of secret negotiations facilitated by Norway and Qatar, establishes a power-sharing government, demilitarized zones, and an international oversight committee to monitor implementation.</p>
    <p>"Today marks not just the end of a conflict, but the beginning of a shared future," said mediator and Nobel Peace Prize laureate Maria Karlsson. "The real work of reconciliation and rebuilding now begins."</p>
    <p>An initial reconstruction fund of $15 billion has been established with contributions from the European Union, United States, China, and regional partners to rebuild infrastructure destroyed during the conflict.</p>`,

    excerpt: 'Historic trade agreement now operational across all 54 signatory nations, creating worlds largest free trade area.',
    content: `<p>The African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) has reached full implementation across all 54 signatory nations, creating the world's largest free trade zone by number of participating countries.</p>
    <p>Early data shows significant increases in intra-African trade, with small and medium enterprises particularly benefiting from simplified cross-border procedures and reduced tariffs.</p>
    <p>"This is Africa's economic coming of age," said AfCFTA Secretary-General Wamkele Mene. "We are witnessing the birth of a truly integrated African economy that will transform the continent's development trajectory."</p>
    <p>Economic analysts project the agreement will boost intra-African exports by over 80% by 2035, creating millions of jobs and lifting an estimated 30 million people out of extreme poverty.</p>`,

    slug: 'global-minimum-corporate-tax',
    excerpt: 'Unprecedented international tax agreement implemented by 136 nations to end tax havens and corporate avoidance.',
    content: `<p>After years of preparation, the global minimum corporate tax rate of 15% has taken effect across 136 nations, representing the most significant redesign of international tax rules in over a century.</p>
    <p>The agreement, first negotiated through the OECD in 2023, aims to eliminate tax havens and prevent multinational corporations from shifting profits to low-tax jurisdictions.</p>
    <p>"This marks the beginning of a fairer era in global taxation," said OECD Secretary-General Mathias Cormann. "For too long, multinational corporations have exploited gaps in international tax rules. That era is now over."</p>
    <p>Initial estimates suggest the agreement will generate over $150 billion in additional global tax revenue annually, with funds earmarked for infrastructure development, education, and healthcare in participating nations.</p>`,
